In this section, we will review some of the main features of a good dissertation proposal. A dissertation proposal should:

1. Have a clear and specific title that reflects the main idea and scope of your research.
2. Provide a brief introduction that explains the background, context, and significance of your research topic.
3. State the main research question or problem that you aim to address in your dissertation.
4. Review the relevant literature and demonstrate how your research fills a gap or contributes to the existing knowledge in your field.
5. Describe the research design and methods that you will use to collect and analyze your data.
6. Outline the expected results and implications of your research.
7. Include a tentative timeline and budget for completing your dissertation.

A dissertation proposal should also follow the formatting and citation guidelines of your academic discipline and institution. You should consult your supervisor and committee for specific requirements and feedback on your proposal.
  
Now that you have an overview of the main elements of a dissertation proposal, let's look at some examples of how to write them. In the book *Writing a Proposal for Your Dissertation: Guidelines and Examples*, you will find several proposals from different disciplines and fields, such as education, psychology, business, nursing, and engineering. Each proposal is annotated with comments and suggestions from the author, who explains the strengths and weaknesses of the writing and how to improve it.
 
For instance, here is an excerpt from a proposal in education:

> **Title:** The Effects of Cooperative Learning on Student Achievement and Motivation in a High School Geometry Class
> 
> 
> **Introduction:** Cooperative learning is a teaching strategy that involves students working together in small groups to achieve a common goal. It is based on the premise that students learn more effectively when they interact with each other and share their ideas and perspectives. Cooperative learning has been widely used in various educational settings and subjects, and has been shown to have positive effects on student achievement, motivation, attitudes, and social skills (Johnson & Johnson, 2009; Slavin, 2014).
> 
> 
> However, there is a lack of research on the effects of cooperative learning on student achievement and motivation in high school geometry classes. Geometry is a challenging subject for many students, as it requires abstract reasoning, spatial visualization, and deductive thinking. Many students struggle with geometry and lose interest and confidence in learning mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000). Therefore, it is important to explore how cooperative learning can enhance student learning and engagement in geometry.
> 
> 
> The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cooperative learning on student achievement and motivation in a high school geometry class. The research questions are:
> 
> 1. What are the effects of cooperative learning on student achievement in geometry?
> 2. What are the effects of cooperative learning on student motivation in geometry?
> 3. How do students perceive cooperative learning in geometry?

In this example, the title is clear and specific, the introduction provides a brief background and context for the research topic, the significance of the study is explained, and the research questions are stated.
